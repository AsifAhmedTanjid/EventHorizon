            — all wrapped in a cosmic theme that keeps things fun.

          <p>
            In astrophysics, the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole — 
            the point where what is inside and outside gets interesting. We loved the metaphor: 
            your ideas exist outside, and your fully executed events exist inside.
